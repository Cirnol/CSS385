<h2><strong>About Linear Algebra</strong></h2>
<p>If you know or have taken a class in linear algebra, this is a good time to dig out your favorite textbook and review the content a little. If you don&rsquo;t know what is linear algebra, you can find out what it is by taking a look at:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take a look at first 4 topics (up to and include dot/cross products)</li>
<li>Take a look at how to multiply matrices and vectors</li>
</ul>
