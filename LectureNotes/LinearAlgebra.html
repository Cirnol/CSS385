<h2><strong>About Linear Algebra</strong></h2>
<p>If you know or have taken a class in linear algebra, this is a good time to dig out your favorite textbook and review the content a little. If you don&rsquo;t know what is linear algebra (I will cover this in class), you can find out what it is by taking a look at:</p>

<li><strong>Vectors</strong>:

<li>Our own book: 
<a href="https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484254424">Notes from this book</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/Apress/basic-math-for-game-dev-w-unity3d">here is the Github source code</a>.

<li>Khan Academy: <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/vectors-and-spaces">https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/vectors-and-spaces</a>
<ul>
<li>Take a look at first 4 topics (up to and include dot/cross products)</li>
<li>Take a look at how to multiply matrices and vectors</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><br>

<li><strong>Transformation and Matrices</strong>: <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/matrix-transformations">https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/matrix-transformations</a>
<ul>
<li>Take a look at first 4 topics (up to and include inverse transforms)</li>
</ul><br>
</li>
<li>Remember that,
<ul>
<li>we will be working in 3D space (4x4 matrices, and 3x1 vectors),</li>
<li>we are going to USE these concepts (again, I will cover all of these in class),</li>
<li>we DO NOT need to proof anything, just understand and know how to use</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, I WILL COVER the above materials in class. You DO NOT need to know any of the above. But, if you are looking for things to do over the next few days, there you have it.</p>
